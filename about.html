        <p>Hi, My name is Maureen and I have always been passionate about googling, researching and acquiring knowledge
            and have dedicated those skills in becoming a python programmer.
            I spent every day of my life for a few months studying and completing projects.
            Throughout my learning stage, I studied every day completing projects and assignments which were 100 in total.
            I have gained Proficiency in Python, knowledge of core libraries and frameworks such as ;Pandas,Numpy,Turtle,
            Tkinter,Selenium,BeautifulSoup, as well as HTML and CSS.I am currently looking for an internship and a
            part-time
            position as I am more productive when I work for short durations and flexible hours while meeting up with
            deadlines and completing projects. I am always willing to go above and beyond to ensure your satisfaction
            and I look forward to the opportunity to work with you and contribute to the success of your next project or company.
        </p>
